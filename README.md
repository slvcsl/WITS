# WITS

**WITS** (Wikipedia for Italian Text Summarization) is a large-scale dataset for abstractive summarization in Italian, built exploiting Wikipedia articlesâ€™ structure. 
WITS contains almost 700,000 Wikipedia articles, together with their human-written summaries. 

Compared to existing data for text summarization in Italian, WITS is more than an order of magnitude larger and more challenging, given its lengthy sources.

The dataset is available through Google Drive [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W-52p4_oUakbr57zZvadoRKSP-vndGlJ/view?usp=sharing).
More details on the data collection are available in the related [paper](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3033/paper65.pdf).

For any question or feedback -- or if you are also intersted in summarization, feel free to contact me at [scasola@fbk.eu](mailto:scasola@fbk.eu)
